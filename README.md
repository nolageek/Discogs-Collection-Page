## Current Functionality:
* Mobile friendly
* Displays gallery view of album covers, with title and artist name(s).
* Auto paginates (50 per page by default,)
* Gallery images link to single release view with more information about release, including ratings/notes on copy in collection.

## To Do: 
* Get better at PHP
* Auto crop images better to square format
* Add dark mode
* ~~Create single release view~~
* ~~Add check to avoid re-downloading folder data that hasn't changed.~~

## To Fix:
* ~~Figure out logic to display Notes in expanded view / release view.~~

# Requirements:
* A Discogs personal access token to access the Discogs API: https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers
